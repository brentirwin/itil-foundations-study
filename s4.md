## Section 4 - Service Design

* Conduct the detailed service planning
* How will it be supported?
* How will it be tested?
* How will future development occur?

Service design is complete when we have a plan:
* Detailed
* Comprehensive
* Effective (not necessarily efficient)
* Agreed upon by stakeholders

Key takeaway: detailed blueprint of the service, including:
* Components of the service
* Identify if resources will be shared with another existing service
* Test plan
* Support plan
* Future development plan

### Objectives of Service Design (lesson 27)

1. To provide guidance on the design and development of both the services and the service management practices
2. To ensure the services meet the current and future needs of the business

* Coordinate Design Activities - Use required resources as efficiently and effectively as possible
* Policies and Standards
	* Produce policies that are subordinate to the Service Strategy policies
	* Should be developed alongside existing local policies in the organization
* Forward-compatible design - Ensure new or changed services may be developed or improved in the future easily
* Plans - Produce or maintain plans/infrastructures/documentation for IT service design
* Costs - Control the long-term costs associated with service provisioning
* Service Management System - Efficient and effective method to manage a given service
* Security and Resilience - There are always trade-offs.
* Efficiency of effort - reduce the requirements for upgrades to a given service
* Skills and capabilities - develop among personnel, functions, and processes

### Complete Service Design (lesson 28)

1. Service solutions - services being designed or changed using a structured approach
2. MIS and tools
	* Service Portfolio
	* Service Knowledge Management System
	* Configuration Management System
3. Technology and management architecture
	* Technical aspects of IT infrastructure
	* Align the mangagement strcuture with the existing business processes; business needs come before technology
4. Processes - all 26 must be designed properly
5. Measurement methods and metrics - develop the list of metrics that will need to be measured (what, how, and how often?)

### The 4 P's of Service Design (lesson 29)

* People - provide, use, or benefit from the service
* Processes - consider all 26 processes during design of a service
* Products - services, technology, tools
* Partners - people and organizations that help provide service (manufacturues, suppliers, vendors, etc.)

### Service Design Packages (SDPs) (lesson 30)

* Key output of Service Design phase
* Part of the formal migration from Service Design to Service Transition
* Blueprint to guide Service Transition
* Detailed requirements for operation and continual improvement
* For Service Retirement - Verifies there are no outstanding dependencies

Parts of the SDP
1. Business Requirements - Why do we need this service?
2. Functional Requirements - Is the service fit for purpose? (utility)
3. Operational Requirements - Is the service fit for use? (warranty)
4. Service Level Requirements - Details the desired level of warranty.
	* Used to negotiate Service Level Agreements to specific quality and service targets to achieve
5. Design Topology - Definition of the service (hardware, software, documentation, processes, metrics, reports)
6. Organizational Readiness Assessment - Builds on top 5 requirements, determines ability to adequately support the service.
	* Finance, tech, resources, employee skill sets, capabilities of suppliers
7. Service Transition Plan - How to build, test, and deploy a new or changed service.
8. Acceptance Criteria - What defines success?
9. Service Program - Draws all parts together into phasing and timelines for transition, operations, and Continual Service Improvement.

No service can move from Design to Transition without a formally accepted SDP.

### Design Coordination Process (lesson 31)

Ensures the objectives of the Service Design phase are met. It is a single point of coordination for all processes and activities in the phase.

* Monitory activies for consistency
* Ensure SDPs conform to standards
* Manage migration of services to Service Transition
* Ensure design conforms to needs
* Improve processes through process owners
* Review and improve processes and activities
* Create and maintain framework for activities
* Guide and support new services
* Manage the progress
* Utility and warranty requirements are addressed

Design Coordinator's challenges
* Must resolve conflicting demands for shared resources
* Must ensure quality of SDPs
* Must meet customer's expectations

### Service Catalog Management Process (lesson 32)

A service catalog is a list and definition of all services available.

* Manage structure and contents of catalog
* Ensure catalog is correct
* Check any changes to the catalog
* Ensure access to the proper people
* Should be widely available (usually)

Service descriptions
* concise
* speaks to service, not an application
* written in plain language

Configuration Management System (CMS)
* Provides overview and lists important features
* Contains detailed info on the components of services
* Service catalog can be derived from the CMS

### Types of Service Catalogs (lesson 33)

**Simple service catalog** - maxtrix of available services

| Service | Students | Instructors | Sales | Payroll |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web browsing | x | x | x | x |
| E-Mail | x | x | x | x |
| Paycheck printing | | | | x |
| IT Service Desk | x | x | x | x |

**Business or customer service catalog** - identifies business processes supported by the services (details can include service hours, SLA info, escalation paths, etc.)

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| --- | --- |
| Process A | Service 1, Service 2 |
| Process B | Service 2, Service 3, Service 4 |
| Process C | Service 4 |

**Technical or supporting service catalog** - covers infrastructure, applications, and outsourced services

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| --- | --- |
| Process A | Service 1, Service 2 |
| Process B | Service 2, Service 3, Service 4 |
| Process C | Service 4 |

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| --- | --- |
| Service 1 | Supporting Services 1 & 3 |
| Service 2 | Supporting Services 1, 2, & 3 |
| Service 3 | Supporting Services 2, 3, & 4 |
| Service 4 | Supporting Services 3 & 4 |

**Alternate Views: Three-View** - split by user-facing, business-business, and technical/supporting

## Service Level Management (SLM) Process (lessons 33-34)

Ensures all current and planned IT services are delivered to agreed-upon targets
* What metrics are we collecting and comparing our performance to?
* What utility and warranty were promised?
* Are targets measureable, achievable, and relevant?

SLM Cycle
1. Negotiate
2. Agree
3. Monitor
4. Report
5. Review

Three Key SLM Documents
* Service Level Agreement (SLA)
	* Formal written agreement between IT provider and customer with key targets and responsibilities of both parties
	* Not a contract
* Operational Level Agreement (OLA)
	* Formal written agreement between two parts of the IT provider
	* Internal, not customer-facing
* Underpinning Contract (UC)
	* Legally binding agreement
	* Negotiated by supplier management

Service Reviews
* Monthly - service manager and customer management
* Quarterly - service owner and customer's equivalent
* Annually - top-level management

SLA Charts
* Red, amber, green (RAG) - color-coded metrics
* Stoplight chart

Service Improvement Plan
* Formal plan for implementing improvements (yellows and reds)
* Fed back into Continual Service Improvement (CSI) phase

Service Level Agreement Structures
* **Service-based structure** - each service has an SLA regardless of number of users
* **Customer-based structure** - each customer has its own SLA regardless of the number of services
* **Multilayer structure** - corporate layer, customer layer, and service layer SLAs
	* Most common type

SLA Types
* **Type I** - between internal provider and internal customers
* **Type II** - Between type I service provider and type II service provider in the same organization
* **Type III** - Contractural SLA as an appendix to a business contract
