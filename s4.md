## Section 4 - Service Design

* Conduct the detailed service planning
* How will it be supported?
* How will it be tested?
* How will future development occur?

Service design is complete when we have a plan:
* Detailed
* Comprehensive
* Effective (not necessarily efficient)
* Agreed upon by stakeholders

Key takeaway: detailed blueprint of the service, including:
* Components of the service
* Identify if resources will be shared with another existing service
* Test plan
* Support plan
* Future development plan

### Objectives of Service Design (lesson 27)

1. To provide guidance on the design and development of both the services and the service management practices
2. To ensure the services meet the current and future needs of the business

* Coordinate Design Activities - Use required resources as efficiently and effectively as possible
* Policies and Standards
	* Produce policies that are subordinate to the Service Strategy policies
	* Should be developed alongside existing local policies in the organization
* Forward-compatible design - Ensure new or changed services may be developed or improved in the future easily
* Plans - Produce or maintain plans/infrastructures/documentation for IT service design
* Costs - Control the long-term costs associated with service provisioning
* Service Management System - Efficient and effective method to manage a given service
* Security and Resilience - There are always trade-offs.
* Efficiency of effort - reduce the requirements for upgrades to a given service
* Skills and capabilities - develop among personnel, functions, and processes

### Complete Service Design (lesson 28)

1. Service solutions - services being designed or changed using a structured approach
2. MIS and tools
	* Service Portfolio
	* Service Knowledge Management System
	* Configuration Management System
3. Technology and management architecture
	* Technical aspects of IT infrastructure
	* Align the mangagement strcuture with the existing business processes; business needs come before technology
4. Processes - all 26 must be designed properly
5. Measurement methods and metrics - develop the list of metrics that will need to be measured (what, how, and how often?)

### The 4 P's of Service Design (lesson 29)

* People - provide, use, or benefit from the service
* Processes - consider all 26 processes during design of a service
* Products - services, technology, tools
* Partners - people and organizations that help provide service (manufacturues, suppliers, vendors, etc.)

### Service Design Packages (SDPs) (lesson 30)

* Key output of Service Design phase
* Part of the formal migration from Service Design to Service Transition
* Blueprint to guide Service Transition
* Detailed requirements for operation and continual improvement
* For Service Retirement - Verifies there are no outstanding dependencies

Parts of the SDP
1. Business Requirements - Why do we need this service?
2. Functional Requirements - Is the service fit for purpose? (utility)
3. Operational Requirements - Is the service fit for use? (warranty)
4. Service Level Requirements - Details the desired level of warranty.
	* Used to negotiate Service Level Agreements to specific quality and service targets to achieve
5. Design Topology - Definition of the service (hardware, software, documentation, processes, metrics, reports)
6. Organizational Readiness Assessment - Builds on top 5 requirements, determines ability to adequately support the service.
	* Finance, tech, resources, employee skill sets, capabilities of suppliers
7. Service Transition Plan - How to build, test, and deploy a new or changed service.
8. Acceptance Criteria - What defines success?
9. Service Program - Draws all parts together into phasing and timelines for transition, operations, and Continual Service Improvement.

No service can move from Design to Transition without a formally accepted SDP.

### Design Coordination Process (lesson 31)

Ensures the objectives of the Service Design phase are met. It is a single point of coordination for all processes and activities in the phase.

* Monitory activies for consistency
* Ensure SDPs conform to standards
* Manage migration of services to Service Transition
* Ensure design conforms to needs
* Improve processes through process owners
* Review and improve processes and activities
* Create and maintain framework for activities
* Guide and support new services
* Manage the progress
* Utility and warranty requirements are addressed

Design Coordinator's challenges
* Must resolve conflicting demands for shared resources
* Must ensure quality of SDPs
* Must meet customer's expectations

### Service Catalog Management Process (lesson 32)

A service catalog is a list and definition of all services available.

* Manage structure and contents of catalog
* Ensure catalog is correct
* Check any changes to the catalog
* Ensure access to the proper people
* Should be widely available (usually)

Service descriptions
* concise
* speaks to service, not an application
* written in plain language

Configuration Management System (CMS)
* Provides overview and lists important features
* Contains detailed info on the components of services
* Service catalog can be derived from the CMS

### Types of Service Catalogs (lesson 33)

**Simple service catalog** - maxtrix of available services

| Service | Students | Instructors | Sales | Payroll |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Web browsing | x | x | x | x |
| E-Mail | x | x | x | x |
| Paycheck printing | | | | x |
| IT Service Desk | x | x | x | x |

**Business or customer service catalog** - identifies business processes supported by the services (details can include service hours, SLA info, escalation paths, etc.)

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| --- | --- |
| Process A | Service 1, Service 2 |
| Process B | Service 2, Service 3, Service 4 |
| Process C | Service 4 |

**Technical or supporting service catalog** - covers infrastructure, applications, and outsourced services

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| --- | --- |
| Process A | Service 1, Service 2 |
| Process B | Service 2, Service 3, Service 4 |
| Process C | Service 4 |

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| --- | --- |
| Service 1 | Supporting Services 1 & 3 |
| Service 2 | Supporting Services 1, 2, & 3 |
| Service 3 | Supporting Services 2, 3, & 4 |
| Service 4 | Supporting Services 3 & 4 |

**Alternate Views: Three-View** - split by user-facing, business-business, and technical/supporting

### Service Level Management (SLM) Process (lessons 33-34)

Ensures all current and planned IT services are delivered to agreed-upon targets
* What metrics are we collecting and comparing our performance to?
* What utility and warranty were promised?
* Are targets measureable, achievable, and relevant?

SLM Cycle
1. Negotiate
2. Agree
3. Monitor
4. Report
5. Review

Three Key SLM Documents
* Service Level Agreement (SLA)
	* Formal written agreement between IT provider and customer with key targets and responsibilities of both parties
	* Not a contract
* Operational Level Agreement (OLA)
	* Formal written agreement between two parts of the IT provider
	* Internal, not customer-facing
* Underpinning Contract (UC)
	* Legally binding agreement
	* Negotiated by supplier management

Service Reviews
* Monthly - service manager and customer management
* Quarterly - service owner and customer's equivalent
* Annually - top-level management

SLA Charts
* Red, amber, green (RAG) - color-coded metrics
* Stoplight chart

Service Improvement Plan
* Formal plan for implementing improvements (yellows and reds)
* Fed back into Continual Service Improvement (CSI) phase

Service Level Agreement Structures
* **Service-based structure** - each service has an SLA regardless of number of users
* **Customer-based structure** - each customer has its own SLA regardless of the number of services
* **Multilayer structure** - corporate layer, customer layer, and service layer SLAs
	* Most common type

SLA Types
* **Type I** - between internal provider and internal customers
* **Type II** - Between type I service provider and type II service provider in the same organization
* **Type III** - Contractural SLA as an appendix to a business contract

### Capacity Management (lessons 36-37)

Ensure the capacity of IT services and infrastrcutre meets the *agreed* capacity and *performance-related* requirements in a *cost-effective* and *timely* manner. Concerned with meeting *current and future* needs.

3 Subprocesses
* Business Capacity Management
	* Aligns CM to business plans
	* Translates requirements into services and infrastrucutre
	* Coordinates with Business Relationship management
* Service Capacity Management
	* Ensures services underpin the business processes and outcomes
	* End-to-end performance of services and workloads
	* Coordinates with Service Portfolio management
* Component Capacity Mangagement
	* Ensures appropriate understanding of techincal components
	* Data analysis techniques for maximizing value
	* Coordinates with CM

* Reactive Activities - Monitoring performance and responding to specific performance issues
* Proactive Activities - Use data to make changes to prevent performance issues
	* Optimize performance, find new technologies, and produce/maintain the capacity plan

Demand Management
* Service providers don't build to peak capacity
* Level the peaks through business practice changes
* Understand patterns of demand
* Constraints on high-demand periods could be financial or physical

Capacity Plan - byproduct of CM process
* Current and historic use levels and performance
* Forecasts capacity changes
* Lists assumptions
* List of recommendations with costs

Importance of Capacity Plan
* IT Director uses it to make decisions
* Balances supply vs demand and cost vs resources
* Can my current infrastructure support a new service?

### Availability Management Process (lesson 38)

Ensures IT availability meets the *agreed-upon*, *current and future* availability needs of the business in a *cost effective and timely* manner.

4 Aspects of Availability (ARMS)
* **Availability** - Does the service perform its function as required?
* **Reliability** - How long can it function without interruption/breaking?
	* Adding redundancy and resiliancy helps reliability.
* **Maintainability** - How quickly and effectively can it get back to normal after a failure?
* **Serviceability** - Can a supplier provide their contractual targets for A, R, and M?
	* Maintain oversight that third parties are doing their duty.

Two types of availability
* **Service availbility** - end-to-end service experienced by end user
* **Component availability** - each individual piece that together provides the end-to-end experience

Customer Satisfaction is derived from service availability (measured in SLAs) and meeting the targets in the service catalog.
* Under-promise and over-deliver

When Things Break
* How you react to failure is important.
* Things will break so be honest.
* Take swift action to get it back online.

Primary Focus Area
* Service availability, not component availability
* End-to-end experience is more important than individual components
* Identify critical business services and make sure your SLA targets them

Be Proactive - Prevent issues before they happen
* Identify weakest links and bottlenecks
* Change early because changes cost exponentially more as services are in operation

### Reactive and Proactive Availability (lesson 39)

**Reactive Functions** - monitoring current availability during service operations. (Help desk)

**Proactive Functions** - analyze reliability and maintainability to take actions to provent future issues.
* Ensure infrastructure is budgeted and planned
* Find new components with better reliability and maintainability
* Produce and maintain availability plan

### Risk Analysis in Availability (lesson 40)

Risk should be identified, analyzed, and managed.

Risk Identification
* Look over all resources and capabilities that enable services
	* Single points of failure
	* Poor skills
	* Unreliable sources

Risk Analysis
* Analyze and measure vulnerabilities identified
* Determine their impact
* Prioritize them
* Indentify the vital business function
	* Understand what is necessary and what is "nice to have"

Risk Management (three options)
1. Remove or avoid (do something different)
2. Mitigate (add redundancy)
3. Accept (risk is low enough, not worth worrying about)

#### Component Failure Impact Analysis (CFIA) (lesson 41)

A matrix that shows what services are affected by what components

#### Fault Tree Analysis (lesson 42)

* Procedure to identify single points of failure using Boolean logic.
* Useful for identifying challenges and issues, but doesn't provide a solution

### Expanded Incident Lifecycle (lesson 43)

A post-mortem using incident data

* **Mean Time Between Failures** (MTBF)
	* How long on average can a certain component run before a failure will occur?
	* Measures **uptime** and **reliability**
* **Mean Time to Resore Services** (MTRS)
	* How long can a service be restored after a failure?
	* Measures **downtime** and **maintainability**
* **Mean Time Between System Incidents** (MTBSI)
	* How often are services disrupted?
	* Measures overall **reliability**

<table>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2">MTBSI</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>MTRS</td>
		<td>MTBF</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Downtime's 5 Steps
1. Detect the incident
2. Diagnose the fault or root cause
3. Repair the issue
4. Recover the component
5. Restore the service

**Overall Goal: Improve MTBF**
- Auto-detect issues
- Run diagnostics
- Pre-position spare components
- Configuration guides
- Restoration checklists

### Availability Measurement (lesson 44)

* Measure services from the end-user perspective in %
* Percentages only measure uptime vs downtime, not amount of effort on your end.

### IT Service Continuity Management (lesson 45)

Support the business continuity management (BCM) arragements by managing risks and disaster recovery.

* Risk analysis focuses on **likely** events
* ITSCM looks at **unlikely** but conceivable events

Initiation
* Agree on a policy
* Set the scope
* For a project
* Get the resources

Requirements and Strategy
* Conduct business impact analysis with customer
* Determine critical business services
* Consider possible events (disaster, terrorism/cyber attack, staff illness/loss)
* Develop a plan for the events

Implementation
* How will we execute the plan?
* Risk mitigation steps
* Publish and test your plan

Ongoing Operation
* Keep the plan updated
* Train the staff on the plan and test periodically (ISO 22301)

### Information Security Management Process (ISyM) (lesson 46)

Aligns IT security with business security

The CIA Triad
* Confidentiality (data is available on a need-to-know basis)
* Integrity (data/services are complete and accurate)
* Availability (customer accesses the data they are authorized to)

* Relevant to Availability Mangagement
* Plan in Service Design
* Test in Service Transition
* Monitor during Service Operation

Information security is important when you outsource

### Supplier Management Process (lesson 47)

Ensure good service from the right suppliers

* Follow contract management's policy
* Produce an enforceable supplier policy
* Maintain a Supplier Contractor Management Information System (SCMIS)
* Categorize suppliers and contracts
* Undertake risk assessments on contracts
* Negotiate/manage contracts
* Manage performance of suppliers
* Ensure subcontractors are managed openly by prime supplier

Suppliers
* **Strategic suppliers** - involve senior managers and sharing long-term plans
* **Tactical suppliers** - commercial activity and business interaction
* **Operational suppliers** - supply operational services
* **Commodity suppliers** - provision of low-value products
