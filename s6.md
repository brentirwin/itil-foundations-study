## Section 6 - Service Operation

This is where we provide a service to a customer to provide value.
* Urgent operational problems are handled here.
* Bigger issues are fed back into earlier stages.

Work with what you've got
* Service Operation requires you to be flexible
* Don't have the benefit of re-engineering from the start
* Operations must continue alongside Continual Service Improvements

Key Takeaways
* This stage never ends.
* Provides users with value.
* Faults are quickly fixed or sent back to an earlier stage.

#### Objectives of Service Operation (lesson 73)

* Deliver and support IT services
* Minimize the impact of failure
* Control access to services

Scope
* Services
* People
* Processes
	* Event Management
	* Incident Management
	* Problem Management
	* Request Fulfillment
	* Access Management
* Technology

#### Principles of Service Operation (lesson 74)

1. Balance
	1. Internal IT vs external business requirements
	2. Stability vs responsiveness
	3. Cost vs quality
	4. Proactive vs reactive
2. Communication
	- Between users and customers
	- Between operational teams/shifts
	- In performance reporting
	- With projects and programs
	- For any changes and releases
	- For any failures and emergencies

### Event Managment (lesson 75)

To manage __events__ throughout their lifecycle (usually short).

An event is a change of state that is significant for the IT service management.

Functions
* Detect changes of state that affect any CI
* Identify the type of event and take action
* Trigger other Service Management processes
* Capture performance info to compare against SLA targets
* Provide inputs into CSI

#### Alerts & Event Types (lesson 76)

Alert - automated warning that something has occurred

Event Types
* **Informational** - shows everything is operating properly
	- Considered a completed event and logged in the CMS
* **Warning** - something isn't operating properly; some threshold has been crossed
	- Trigger Problem Managment process to determine cause
	- Logged in CMS
* **Exceptions** - an error condition has occurred; performance is currently unacceptable
	- Trigger the Incident Management process
	- or create a Change Management issue

### Incident Management (lessons 77-81)

Restore normal service oepration as quickly as possible while maintaining service quality by minimizing adverse impact.

Covers any event that disrupts or may disrupt services.

**Incident** - any unplanned interruption or reduction in quality to an IT service or failure of a CI.

#### Incident Management Process (lesson 79)

1. **Identification** - Triggered by trigger
	* Exception in Event Management
	* Trechnician discovers issue
	* System auto-detects
	* User calls to complain
2. **Logging** - Service desk logs all incidents
3. **Categorization** - Incident vs service request
4. **Determine Priority** - What is the impact/urgency?
	* Determined by SLA, often by timeline
5. **Initial Diagnosis & Escalation**
	* Tier 1 is triage.
	* Service Desk escalates if it needs a specialist
6. **Escalation**
	* Functional - most common, requires a specialist
	* Hierarchical - referred to management due to severity, affected user, or permissions
7. **Resolution and Restoration**
	* Complete investigation and appropriate correction
	* Solution reported back to Service Desk and the user
8. **Closure** - just because tech says it's fixed doesn't mean it's fixed.
	* Check with user that it is fixed.
	* Close the ticket with what was wrong and how it was fixed.

#### Major Incidents (lesson 80)

An incident labeled as "major" during prioritization, based on predefined criteria.
* Reported to Service Desk Manager and the IT Director

Major Incident Teams
* pre-planned responses for major likely events
* Service Desk still own the incident

#### Models for Incident Handling (lesson 81)

* **Generic Models** - most common, used for handling initial logging and categorization
* **Specific Models** - once categorized, analyst can move to a specific model for common issues

Incident matching
* Help desk should try to match incident to known existing incidents
* Can identify trends to be addressed
* Can match the symptoms to a database of known incidents
