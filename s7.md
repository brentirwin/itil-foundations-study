## Section 7 - Continual Service Improvement

* Occurs during all stages, most useful during Service Operations
* Identifies areas for improvement in processes and functions
* Main effort is increasing efficiency

Key Takeaways
* Capture relevant info for appropriate fixes
* Verify interprocess links as functional, effective, and efficient
* Occurs at all stages (even on itself)
* Service Operations data is critical

### Objectives of CSI (lesson 98)

* Measure and identify the value of initiatives
* Review trends to ensure services meet SLAs
* Do outcomes of processes meet standards?
* Review business trends, priorities, and projections
* Perform customer satisfaction surveys
* Conduct maturity assessments against process, functions, activities, and roles
* Internal and external service reviews
* Internal audits to verify compliance with processes and activities
* Review existing deliverables

### Principles of CSI (lesson 99)

Deming Cycle
* **Plan** - Establish objectives and processes to get there
* **Do** - Implement the plan and collect appropriate data
* **Check** - Study the data
* **Act** - Improve original plan

Continual Service Improvement Register
* Central repository for documenting all potential improvement opportunities (areas for improvement database)
* All stakeholders can make entries
* Owned by CSI Manager
* CSI register is large
* Allows cross-sync of "good ideas" for maximum ROI

CSI Register Items
* Description
* Scale
* Timeline
* Resources needed
* Originator and Sponsor
* Cross-references (CSI Items, RFCs, project proposals)

### CSI Process (lesson 100-103)

Define and manage improvements. We want to make things better.

Functions
* Identify opportunities for improvement
* Reduce cost of services
* Identify what metrics to capture
* Review service achievements
* Understand what to measure and why
* Define the objective: What is a successful outcome?

#### 7 Steps to Service Improvement

**Plan**

1. Define the vision/strategy
2. Define what to measure

**Do**

3. Gather relevant data
4. Process data into information

**Check**

5. Analayze data for trends (knowledge)
6. Leaders asses knowledge and produce improvement plans

**Act**

7. Implement agreed-upon changes

#### An Approach to CSI (lesson 101)

* **What is the vision?** - Understand teh business's vision, goals, and objectives
* **Where are we now?** - Be honest about your organization, people, processes, & technology
* **Where do we want to be?** - Create achievable steps to meet the agreed-upon goals and time tables
* **How do we get there?** - Develop a plan that is realistic and achievable
* **Did we get there?** - Verify process compliance, analyze the metrics, and create another baseline
* **How do we keep the momentum?** - Find the next project or initiative to snowball your current momentum

#### Metrics and Measures (lesson 102)

* Validate previous decisions
* Are we meeting the SLAs?
* Justify course of action
* Course correct errors

Baselines in Measurement
* Snapshot of an area in the CMS
* Create baseline before and after a change to see if it was effective

**Metrics** - Measure that is captured and reported on
* Technology Metrics - component- or application-based
	* Server Availability or app performance
* Process Metrics - Captured using workflow tools
* Service Metrics - end-to-end experience

Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
* Metric used to help manage an IT service, process, or activity
* Quantitative - based on numbers
* Qualitative - subjective
* KPIs are supported by metrics

Critical Success Factor (CSF)
* Thing that MUST happen for an IT service to succeed
* CSFs are supported by related KPIs

Measuring Objectives
* Supported by CSFs

#### Putting CSI Into Practice (lesson 103)

How to put it into practice
* Leadership buy-in is crucial
* Get better at operations
* Get control over Change Management
* Improve Configuration Management
* Focusing on managing services, not technology

What if you are in charge?
* Make small wins and build momentum
* Partnerships with the right people will pay off
* Learn to influence others to achieve your goals

Kotter's 8 Steps to Change
1. Create a sense of urgency.
2. Form a guiding coalition.
3. Create a vision.
4. Communicate the vision.
5. Empower others to act on the vision.
6. Plan for and create quick wins.
7. Consolidate improvements and produce more change.
8. Institutionalize the change.

Bottom Line
* You need to build a culture of change and improvement.
* Look for efficiencies and quick wins.
* Build your partnerships.

### Tools in CSI (lesson 105)

* Any tools from other phases are useful in CSI
* CSI helps determine the best tools for each phase

Useful areas
* Event/incident/problem management
* Systems and network management
* Service requests
* Knowledge management
* Performance management
* IT service management
* Financial management

Always continually evaluate tools.
