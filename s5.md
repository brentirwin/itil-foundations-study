## Section 5 - Service Transition

This is the stage when services are built.
* Coordination is key among stakeholders, customers, users, and support organizations.
* Create end-to-end testing.

Key takeaways
* Physical implementation of new service
* Tested in a live environment
* Configuration has been documented
* Operations has been trained

### Objectives of Service Transition (lesson 51)

* To plan and manage service changes while managing transition risks.
* To ensure services meet the business's needs and create value.

1. Plan and manage service changes efficiently and effectively using eight processes.
2. Manage risks.
3. Successfully deploy into environment.
4. Manage expectations of new or changed services.
5. Create business avlue.
6. Create knowledge management system.

### Outsourcing in Service Transition (lesson 52)

Set up appropriate contracts with outside services.
* Outcomes are facilitated by the services without the detailed costs and risks

1. **Traditional Outsourcing** - transfer services from internal provisioning to an external provider.
2. **Changing Outsourcing** - transfer services from one external supplier to another external supplier.
3. **Re-Insourcing** - transfer services from ane xternal supplier to your in-hour team.
4. **Partnership or Co-Sourcing** - Migrate to a partnership agreement where some of the service is outsourced and some is in-house.
5. **Co-Sourcing/Multi-sourcing** - Using multiple suppliers (increasing service level management complexity)

### Transition Planning and Support (lesson 53)

Provide planning for Service Transition and coordinate resources

Functions
* Plan and coordinate resources for multiple concurrent transitions
* Lean major changes through the Transition stage
* Migrate new or change services to operations
* Establish new/improved management systems and tools
	* 5 pieces of holistic Service Design
* Provide transition plans to align business changes and service transition
* Identify, manage, and control risks across the other processes
* Monitor and improve Service Transition stage

### Knowledge Management (lesson 54)

* Ensure that reliable and secure information are available to decision makers
* Ensure service management data is collected and maintained
* Create and maintina information management system

KM occurs in all stages of ITIL lifecycle.

- Service Knowledge Management System (SKMS)
	- Configuration Management System (CMS)
		- Configuration Management Databases (CMDB)

### Service Asset and Configuration Management (lessons 55-57)

Ensure required assets are managed and information is accurate/reliable.

* Don't start until change control and management are in place
* SACM is powerful because of relationship between configuration items.

Functions
* Keep accurate information on configuration items.
* Historical information is necessary.
* Ensures only authorized components are used.
* Ensures only authorized changes occur.
* Supports other processes across lifecycle.

#### SACM Definitions and Concepts

* **Configuration Items (CIs)** - individual records in Configuration Management Database (CMDB) of assets that need to be managed.
	* Hardware, software, people, documentation, physical locations
* **Levels** - Consider how detailed CIs should be.
* **Naming** - Determine uniform naming convention.
* **Labels** - How to assign labels to assets? Hardware? People? Software?
* **Atributes** - What do you want to know about the CI?
	* Description, unique ID, location, etc.
* **Configurations** - Group of CIs to make up a specific build.
* **Baselines** - Snapshot of a configuration.
* **Configuration Management System**  - Tools for tracking configruation information.
* **Definitive Media Library (DML)** - Secure storage area for all authorized software versions.

#### 5 Principles

* **Planning and Management** - Make a plan.
* **Identification** - Designate CI types, agree on naming conventions, decide on unique IDs
* **Control** - Integrate SACM into the processes taht produce changes to keep CI up to date
	* Change Management
	* Release and Deployment Management
	* Incident Management
* **Status Accounting** - Status of a CI's changes over time with standard status codes.
* **Verification and Audit** - Is it effective?

### Change Management (lessons 58-64)

To **control** the **lifecycle** of all changes, maximizing **benefit** and minimizing **disruption**.

Functions
* Respond to change-initiating triggers
	* New business requirements
	* Operational failures
	* Improvements and additions
* Manage changes at every stage in service lifecycle

#### 3 Types of Changes (lesson 59)

Emergency Changes
* Address unforeseen issues
* Rapid change is required to continue business operations
* Should still follow documented procedures
	* Clearly define who can declare an emergency change
	* Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB) can be called after hours
	* Testing may be modified or removed
	* RFC and documentation are done after issue resolution

Normal Changes
* Are unique or have a higher risk than a standard change
* Default type of change that occurs; emergency and standard are variations on this.

Standard Changes
* Typical day-to-day changes, low-risk and well-understood
* Minimizes bureaucracy and quickly satisfies customers
* Use a shorter version of the Normal Change procedures
	* Generally follow predefined, automated workflow
	* Don't need CAB approval

Why do changes fail?
* Wider impact than imagined
* Insufficient resources
* Stakeholder disagreements about who can authorize
* Poorly planned/conducted testing
* Users not ready
* Support organizations not ready
* Rolled out prematurely due to management pressure
* Two incompatible changes at once

#### Change Process Flow (lesson 60)

1. **Initiation**
	* Initiated by trigger
	* Priority must be determined
2. **Initial Review**
	* Determine if change is realistic
	* Must be documented in CMS
3. **Raise Request for Change (RFC)**
	* "Move, Add, Change" (MAC)
	1. Raised - Who requested it?
	2. Reason - Why is it needed?
	3. Return - ROI?
	4. Risks - What are the uncertainties?
	5. Resources - What does it cost?
	6. Responsible - Who's the owner?
	7. Relationship - with other changes
4. **Assess and Evaluate**
	* Analyze change and get recommendations
5. **Authorization to Proceed**
	* Get permission from Change Advisory Board (CAB)
6. **Build and Test**
	* Owner/Sponsor builds
	* Service Validation and Testing tests it
7. **Authorization to Implement**
	* Test results presented to CAB for approval and scheduling
8. **Implementation**
	* Release and Deployment team implement the change in the production environment
9. **Remediation**
	* Back out plan if it doesn't work properly
	* Is there a point of no return?
10. **Review**
	* If implementation is successful, review occurs on accepted timeline
11. **Closure**
	* Results of review are recorded
	* Lessons learned identified
	* Change pushed to CSI
	* CAB authorizes closure.

#### Change Advisory Board (CAB) (lesson 61)

* Makes major decisions for all changes
* Meet on regular basis
* One master CAB may oversee smaller CABs

Members
* Change Manager (Chariman)
* Service Desk Manager
* Capacity Manager
* IT Security Manager
* etc

CAB Meeting Inputs
* Minutes of previous meeting
* Any Emergency CAB activity
* New changes for decision
* Changes ready for implementation
* Change reviews completed since last meeting
* Any improvement initiatives

CAB Meeting Outputs
* Minutes of meeting
* Authorized new changes
* Rejected changes
* Updated change schedule
* Update Project Service Outage (PSO)

CAB Chairman's Role
* Enforces standards and processes
* Ensures all change authorities have approved the changes before he does
* Provides final approval on RFC

#### Change Authority (lesson 62)

* CAB is an advisory board to make *recommendations* to the Change Authority, a stakeholder for any change.
* RFC documents Change Authority during "Raising of an RFC" in change workflow.

#### Change Models (lesson 63)

Simple or complex?

Standard Change Model
* Covers all the technical details and angles of the proposed change
* Detailed plan for routine tasks

Normal Change Model
* Not as detailed because they are new and unique

Models provide guidance and checklists when limited time is available in emergency situations.

#### Change Documents (lesson 64)

* **Request for Change**
	* Formal change proposal
	* Manages change throughout the process
* **Change Record**
	* Gives details to the RFC
* **CAB Minutes**
	* Meeting minutes with details
* **Change Schedule**
	* State changes to be implemented and when
* **Project Service Outage**
	* Notifies everyone of any changes to normal service availability
